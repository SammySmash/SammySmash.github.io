## About

Hi, my name is Samip Poudel but I usually go by Sammy. 
<br>I’m a Full-Stack Software Engineer from Epic Systems. I have experience owning project components end-to-end,
contributing to system design, and shipping reliable features in complex, production-scale environments. 
<br>Currently seeking an opportunity to harness these skills and build a lifelong career in software development.
